# skin-deep: Generate faces with smoother skin

This program takes effective steps to generate pixels with smooth skin:
1. Skin detection: detect image pixels and regions that contain skin-tone color.
2. Edge detection: obtain an edge map for applying noise reduction over skin.

## Build and Verify

Run `make` and you should see the generated `main` file. Its usage:
```
./main -i <infile.jpg> [-l denoise_level] [-o output_img_name]
```

The default output filename is `out.jpg`.
